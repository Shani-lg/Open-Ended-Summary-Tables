## trying to convert insurance data from binary to categorical

library(reshape2)
library(tidyverse)

df=data.frame(c("insJob", "insMcareMcaid", "insLTC", "insDisability", "insOthWhat" ))
```

```{r}
 ##pull rows related to insurance out of dataset
insurance <- ParticipantDemo.Pull2 %>% select(1, 17:21)
##match rows to id column 
long=melt(insurance,id=1)
#only keep 1's
long=long[which(long$value==1),]
#merge in ids for NA entries
long=merge(insurance[,1,drop=F],long,all.x=T)
View(long)
```

```{r}
##This merges the two datasets into one, in long format
total <- merge(ParticipantDemo.Pull2, long, by = "ï..StudyID")

##I did it!! This aggregates the long data and allows me to have multiple types of insurance in the insurance (variable) column. Then it merges the long and wide data into wide format with the newly created column. (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13795421/multiple-values-in-one-cell-using-r)

aggregated <- aggregate(variable~ï..StudyID, long, paste, collapse=",", na.action=na.pass)

long_wide <- merge(ParticipantDemo.Pull2, aggregated, "ï..StudyID")

##renamed variable column as insurance, might rename others later for ease in understanding
long_wide = long_wide %>% rename(Insurance = variable)

## selected columns for analysis
 long_wide_for_dabblingdata <- select(long_wide, 5:16, 22:25)
```

 ## used this website (https://dabblingwithdata.wordpress.com/2018/01/02/my-favourite-r-package-for-summarising-data/) to find ways to summarize data. This is using Hmisc_describe. I need to look at the output and likely make some adjustments and learn about some of the descriptors. 

library(Hmisc)
Hmisc::describe(long_wide_for_dabblingdata)
```

```{r}
## This uses psych_describe. It converts categorical to numeric summaries and stars them. I will use formattable package to reformat this

library(psych)
psych::describe(long_wide_for_dabblingdata)

```

```{r}
## This uses skimr_skim. Cool mini histograms for numerical, pretty useless for categorical.

library(skimr)
skim(long_wide_for_dabblingdata)


```

```{r}
## This uses summarytools_dfSummary

library(summarytools)
dfSummary(long_wide_for_dabblingdata)

```

```{r}
## From another website (http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/articles/tbl_summary.html)

library(gtsummary)
tbl_summary(long_wide_for_dabblingdata)
View(long_wide_for_dabblingdata)

```
